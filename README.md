# Mashaheer

Welcome to **Mashaheer**, a digital twist on the classic game "Guess Who?" with a celebrity spin. This project is a web-based game where players engage in a battle of wits against the computer, using a series of questions to deduce the identity of a hidden celebrity.

## Technologies Used
- **Front-end**: React with Vite
- **Back-end**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: MySQL

## Project Status
This is my second project using React, and it's currently in a single-player mode where the game logic is handled through a series of nested conditions to emulate AI behavior.

## Gameplay
Players choose from a list of questions to narrow down a pool of celebrities until they can guess the computer's chosen figure. The game is optimized for **desktop screens**, but can be played on mobile devices in **landscape mode** for the best experience.

## Future Updates
- Multiplayer functionality
- Expanded database of celebrities and questions
- Adaptive AI for more dynamic gameplay

Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements. Your contributions and feedback are welcome!
